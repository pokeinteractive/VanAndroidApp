If you wish to run Uniform Server from a folder containing spaces in its path
copy file run_on_drive_w.bat to folder UniServer double click to start servers.

Using this file creates a virtual drive named W mapping folder UniServer to its
root (top level). This eliminates spaces at the expense of using a free
drive letter.

The above method is suitable only for running servers as a standard program.
Do NOT use this method when installing servers as a service.

Note:
Virtual drive letter assignments are permanent, until either explicitly
released or after a PC restart. To explicitly release drive letter first stop
Uniform Server and run the following batch file: remove_drive_w.bat
